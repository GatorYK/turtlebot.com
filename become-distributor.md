# Become a Manufacturer or Distributor

The Open Source Robotics Foundation licenses the use of the TurtleBot trademark for manufacturing and distributing TurtleBot branded products. Controlling the use of the TurtleBot trademark ensures the highest quality user experience for TurtleBot users and community.
<br>

There are two licenses available, one for manufacturing and one for distributing. A licensed manufacturer can produce TurtleBot branded products and sell them to licensed TurtleBot distributors. TurtleBot distributors are licensed to sell TurtleBot branded products to their region.

##  Distributors

Applications for distributors will be evaluated by The Open Source Robotics Foundation for their ability to add value for the users for the licensing region, such as language support/translation for tutorials and other documentation. They will be expected to provide ongoing support to the TurtleBot user community in their region.
