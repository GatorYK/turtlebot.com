## Local testing
If you would like to develop/test locally. Install Docker >= 1.3 and then run `test_site.bash`,
This will build a docker container and install jekyll in the container.
Then run jekyll's test server on the current directory.

You will then be able to view the rendering of the site at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
